This is my first elixir tutorial

Important commands:
* mix new project_name: A bit like rebar create-app appid=project_name in rebar.
* iex -S mix: starts your interactive shell while running the mix script.
* recompile/0: just recompiles everything inside your root project.
* mix deps.get: kind of like rebar get-deps.
* mix docs: generates html document based on comments.
